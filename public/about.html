<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. I am Yashita Sharma. I am a self-taught software developer by truly harnessing the power of online community of coding tutors.</p>

<p>More than coding this self teaching journey has actually taught me how to learn. I am now in love with the 'process of learning in general'.</p>

<p>Another incredibly fulfilling experience of my life was studying and staying at IITM campus for 3 years. I was a whole different, more confident, more active and more rational person while leaving the campus.</p>
